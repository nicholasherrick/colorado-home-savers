              We can put up a for sale sign on your front lawn, or if you would
              rather not advertise to your neighbors that you are selling, we
              can forego the for sale sign
            </h3>

              The benefit of having a for sale sign is that buyers not working
              with a real estate agent can inquire about the sale. If we find a
              buyer not yet being represented, I can represent them as a
              transaction broker and relieve you of the cost of having to pay a
              buyerâ€™s agent. This could save you thousands of dollars in real
              estate commissions and happens more often than you might think.

              I can accurately do a comprehensive CMA (Comparative Market
              Analysis) <a href='*'>[click to see an example]</a> so that we can
              together come up with the highest price point to sell your
              property.

            <p>
              I will hold open houses to help sell your property. This is a good
              way for potential buyers to come see your house without having to
              set up appointments or have a real estate agent present. This
              again can save you thousands of dollars in real estate commissions
              if I find a buyer who is not yet being represented by a real
              estate agent.

              If you are in a hurry, I have a network of dozens of investors
              willing to pay you in cash within a week or two. This can be a
              scenario where you can sell to the highest bidder; however, it
              typically will not be offers that are as high as putting your
              house on the{' '}
