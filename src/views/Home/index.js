              text='Many people do not realize that there is a lot of time in the Colorado foreclosure process. First you miss at least three mortgage payments, maybe more, before your mortgage lender takes action. Then they have to file for foreclosure with the Public Trustee of the County your property resides in. This is called a Notice of Election and Demand (NED). They have to publish their intent to foreclose in several publications. This process can take several weeks. Once this process is done, the Public Trustee sets an auction or sale date which is anywhere from 110 to 130 days out. This auction, or sale date, is the deadline to save your property by noon the day before the date of the auction. As you see, once you stop paying your mortgage, you have at least six months, maybe much longer, to work to save your property before it can be taken away from you. I had a client once where the foreclosure process took more than two years. Unfortunately for him, he moved his family out of the house, against my recommendation, as soon as he stopped paying his mortgage and began renting. He said he wanted to get settled somewhere so he didnâ€™t have to uproot his kids from schools, friends, etc. He could have lived in his home for more than two years without paying a dime in mortgage or rent payments, so it is important to NOT move out of your house. Let the process unfold until you are sure of the exact deadline. I have been successful in many cases extending the auction date out further and further, giving my clients even more time to avoid foreclosure.'
              text2='Now that you know the timeline you can see how long you have to avoid foreclosure. Avoiding foreclosure is so important. Unlike a bad mark on your credit report which is removed from your record usually within six to ten years, a foreclosure is forever and is always in the county records where you reside. It is important to not lose your home to foreclosure.'
              text3='There are many ways to avoid foreclosure. The one that is right for you depends on your situation. Give me a call at (720) 291-2126 and I will be happy to give you a free no-cost explanation of what I think is the best path for you based on your situation. But call soon. The more time you have based on the time line I explained earlier, the more likely you are to have a good resolution'
